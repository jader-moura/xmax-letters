# Xmax Letters

<img src="/public/xmax-letters.png" align="right" />

This year I was looking to find a way to help Santa, and I was wondering why not develop an application to help with his letters. That would be easy for him and can also save trees. To do it I developed an MVP for Santa Claus to receive and read his letters.

Please fill free to send a letter to Santa Claus (he's already receiving it), like any other letter you cannot edit or exclude it (only Mr. Santa can). Some tips, you can ask for toys and candies, jobs, promotions, or just wishes for something good for Christmas or Next Year.
